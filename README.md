# scripts

Miscellaneous scripts.

* `lib/functions.bash` - Sourced to get some utility functions
* `main` - Scripts I created or modified from the original.
* `other` - Scripts I did not create or modify.
* `setup` - Scripts used to set up stuff. All scripts should check if they should run and should be idempotent.
